# Airport challenge

I decided to follow the provided 'user stories' and and turn them into feature tests and then unit tests.

The unit tests are mainly organised by method name.

After obtaining the same error at both feature and unit level, I started writing the code for the rb.files.



This is a partial solution since I still need to fix one of the edge test cases.
